# Client-server
Simple communication between client system and server.
The server listens on a specific port, and the client connects to that port. The client sends a request (simulated string in this case), and the server sends a response back (also a simulated string).

Remember to compile and run the server and client separately. The server should be running before the client attempts to connect. Additionally, you may need to modify the IP address in the client code to match the address where your server is running.

The algorithm used in server.cpp is parallel BFS.
